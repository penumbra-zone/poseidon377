# SP1 Poseidon benchmark

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/getting-started/install.html)

## Cycle tracking

```sh
cd poseidon-sp1/script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This should output the cycle counts for each of the functions in the program,
which for a 4:1 Poseidon hash is 2.9 million cycles, and for a 2:1 Poseidon hash
is 2.1 million cycles.

## Running the Project

There are four main ways to run this project: build a program, execute a program, generate a core proof, and
generate an EVM-compatible proof.

### Build the Program

To build the program, run the following command:

```sh
cd program
cargo prove build
```

### Execute the Program

To run the program without generating a proof:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This will execute the program and display the output.

### Generate a Core Proof

To generate a core proof for your program:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --prove
```

### Generate an EVM-Compatible Proof

> [!WARNING]
> You will need at least 128GB RAM to generate a Groth16 or PLONK proof.

To generate a proof that is small enough to be verified on-chain and verifiable by the EVM:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release --bin evm -- --system groth16
```

this will generate a Groth16 proof. If you want to generate a PLONK proof, run the following command:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin evm -- --system plonk
```

These commands will also generate fixtures that can be used to test the verification of SP1 zkVM proofs
inside Solidity.

### Retrieve the Verification Key

To retrieve your `programVKey` for your on-chain contract, run the following command:

```sh
cargo prove vkey --elf elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
```
